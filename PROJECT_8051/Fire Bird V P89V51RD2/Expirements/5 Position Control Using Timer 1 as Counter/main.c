		Platform: Fire Bird V P89V51RD2
		Position Control Using Timer 1 as Counter
		Written by: Omkar Pradhan, NEX Robotics Pvt. Ltd.
		Edited By: Sachitanand Malewar, NEX Robotics Pvt. Ltd.
		Last Modification: 2009-12-08
		This programme counts encoder pulses from the right motor's position encoder using Timer 1 as counter
		at its external clock pin,  compares them to a required distance and stops robot after covering
		required distance. 
		Compiled with: uVision3 V3.90; C Compiler: C51.Exe, V8.18
