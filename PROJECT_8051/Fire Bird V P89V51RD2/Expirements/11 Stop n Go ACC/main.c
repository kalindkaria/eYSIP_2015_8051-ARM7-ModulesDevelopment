		This program uses ADC0808 Analog to Digital Converter to aquire analog sensor data from the robot.
		Using this sensor data robot follows white line and maintain safe distance from the front obstacle.
		This analog data is displayed as a 8 element array onto the LCD screen by using a .h file "lcd_array_disp.h"
		Compiled with: uVision3 V3.90; C Compiler: C51.Exe, V8.18
